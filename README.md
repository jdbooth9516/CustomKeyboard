# CustomKeyboard

### Capstone project for my BootCamp 

At the end of the 10 day sprint we have a themed Ecommersite that uses the following 

#### Backend 
Django Rest Frameword, MySQL, 

#### Frontend 
React, JS, axios, reactstrap and bootstrap, stripes API, Chart JS

### Overview 
The site has a customer facing side and an employeed faceing side  
on the customer faceing site they can get all the information and have a questionary that will point then in the right 
direction on a build. Then they can build and order the keyboard. The customer can have multiple builds saved as well as payment accounts. 

On the employee side of things the can make changes to the products as well as see and overview of all the orders  and they get charts based what 
products that customers have selected for their builds.
